# Analysis of COVID-19’s Impact on Foot Traffic in Charleston

Abstract—Using mobile phone data collected anonymously by Safegraph for the Charleston-North Charleston, SC Metro Area from January 1, 2018, until February 14, 2022, I analyzed COVID-19’s impact on the Charleston-North Charleston Metro Area by comparing foot traffic from 2019 to 2020 and then to 2021. I attempted to build K-Means clustering models for each season (Winter, Spring, Fall, and Summer) that could predict a week of foot traffic in Charleston based on the previous week. The SafeGraph dataset contains weekly patterns for each location in Charleston, including visit counts broken down by day and hour and information about the people visiting each location, such as the neighborhood they live in and other locations they visit.  My model and analysis provides insight into how COVID-19 has impacted foot traffic in Charleston, SC, USA. This GitHub contains the code used to preprocess the data and create the model and visualizations.
